I created a node.js app called LIRI. LIRI is like SIRI
It must be run in the command line
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface
LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data
LIRI will do any of the below command when you enter them into the command line.
-Tweets from my twitter
-Songs from spotify
-Movies from OMDB
Type in node liri.js to get the instructions on how to enter the commands correctly. So if you were to type the below command you'd get my last 20 tweets I created (Each of the tweets are one word.)

Spotify API will show the following information about the song in the terminal

artist(s)
song name
preview link of the song from spotify
album that the song is a part of

OMDB API will show the following

this would output the following information to the terminal:
